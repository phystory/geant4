1. Geometry

We vary the number of tubes, the radius, the number of Rings etc. in the file run.cc

We use standard materials defined in G4NistManager and called in the Construction file.

The 3He ist defined with 10 bar at room temperature (21 deg Celsius)

Al Tubes are used!


2. Physics

We use the QGSP_BIC_HP physics list.


3. Output files

Output files are root files stored in the directory G4Data.
The output structure is coded in MyStat.cc

4. Visualization 

Turned off!
